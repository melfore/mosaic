## Local usage

Use this guide to locally use/test `@melfore/mosaic` on projects, while developing new features.

1. Install [`yalc`](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc) local package manager

   `npm i yalc -g`

2. Build `@melfore/mosaic`

   `npm run build`

3. Publish locally `@melfore/mosaic`

   `yalc publish --push --private`

   You will get something similar in the output:

   `@melfore/mosaic@0.1.0-6ea98d41 published in store.`

4. Move to the folder of the utilizing project and add local dependency for `@melfore/mosaic` (it will temporary replace the dependency for the online package)

   `yalc add @melfore/mosaic`

   You will see the new entry in your `package.json`
   Remember to add these two rules to your `.gitignore` to avoid pushing to repo:

   `/.yalc`

   `yalc.lock`

5. Update `node_modules` and local dependencies

   `npm install`

6. Import and use components in your code

   ```
   import { MosaicComponent } from '@melfore/mosaic';

   ...

   <MosaicComponent
       label="Learn React"
       onClick={() => window.open('https://reactjs.org', '_blank')}
   />
   ```

## Snippets for VSCode

In order to speed up development when working on `Mosaic` components please add the following snippets for the category `typescriptreact` in `VSCode`.

To add the snippets:

1. Open the `VSCode > Preferences > User Snippets` menu

2. Scroll down the list of categories till you find `typescriptreact`

3. Copy and paste the following code into the file opened by `VSCode`:

   ```
   {
     "TSReactComponent": {
       "prefix": "New Component",
       "body": [
         "import React, { FC } from 'react';",
         "import MUI$1 from '@material-ui/core/$1';",
         "",
         "interface $2 {",
         "",
         "}",
         "",
         "/**",
         " * $3 component made on top of `@material-ui/core/$1`",
         " */",
         "const $3: FC<$2> = ({}) => {",
         "  return null;",
         "};",
         "",
         "export default $3;",
         "",
       ],
       "description": "Snippet for a new TSReact Component"
     },
     "TSReactStory": {
       "prefix": "New Story",
       "body": [
         "import React from 'react';",
         "import {  } from '@storybook/addon-actions';",
         "import {  } from '@storybook/addon-knobs';",
         "import {  } from '../../types/$1';",
         "import { DOCS_PAGE_STRUCTURE, StoriesWrapper } from '../../utils/storybook';",
         "import $2 from '.';",
         "",
         "export default {",
         "  title: '$2',",
         "  component: $2,",
         "  parameters: {",
         "    ...DOCS_PAGE_STRUCTURE,",
         "  },",
         "}",
         "",
         "export const Canvas = () => (",
         "  <$2 />",
         ");",
         "",
         "export const OtherStories = () => (",
         "  <StoriesWrapper>",
         "    <$2 />",
         "  </StoriesWrapper>",
         ");",
         "",
       ],
       "description": "Snippet for a new TSReact story"
     }
   }
   ```

4. To use a snippet (ex: creating a new component), create the empty file in the desired location (ex: `NewComponent > index.tsx`).

5. Then open `VSCode` shortcuts menu and search for `Insert Snippet` option, it will give you hints based on file type

6. Pick the desired snipped and start developing ðŸš€
